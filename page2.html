				<h3>Tivoli Gardens</h3>
				<p>Tivoli Gardens was founded in 1843 and has become a national treasure and an international attraction. Fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen visited many times, as did Walt Disney and many other celebrities, who all fell in love with the gardens.Part of Tivoli Gardens' secret is that there is something for everyone. The scenery is beautiful with exotic architecture, historic buildings and lush gardens. At night, thousands of coloured lights create a fairy tale atmosphere that is completely unique.</p>

				<h3>The Little Mermaid</h3>
				<p>Unveiled on 23 August 1913, The Little Mermaid was a gift from Danish brewer Carl Jacobsen to the City of Copenhagen.The sculpture is made of bronze and granite and was inspired by Hans Christian Andersenâ€™s fairy tale about a mermaid who gives up everything to be united with a young, handsome prince on land.Every morning and evening she swims to the surface from the bottom of the sea and, perched on her rock in the water, she stares longingly towards the shore hoping to catch a glimpse of her beloved prince.</p>

				<h3>Kronborg Castle</h3>
				<p>Kronborg Castle is probably the most famous Danish castle, known worldwide from Shakespeare's Hamlet. Hamlet's spirit is still roaming the hallways of Kronborg, and every summer you can experience Hamlet Scenen perform Hamlet on an open air stage in the courtyard.Frederik 2's Kronborg is at once an elegant castle and a monumental military fortress surrounded by considerable fortifications with bastions and ravelins. It has not been inhabited by the royal family since the late 1600's.The castle houses collections of Renaissance and Baroque interiors, and among the main attractions is the 62-metre ballroom, the very well-preserved chapel and the mythologiacal statue of Holger Danske in Kasematterne below the castle.</p>
